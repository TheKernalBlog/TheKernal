What is the reason that you switched to Linux? Was it low hardware requirements, more customization, or even a more powerful system. For me, it was to get away from all of
the creepy tracking that Microsoft and Apple are doing. Well, if you would like to take the extra privacy and security that using Linux offers you to a whole other level,
I am going to show and explain 3 of the best Linux distros that allow you to do all of your daily activities without having your every move be tracked by Google or any other
big company.

## Qubes OS

Out of the 3 distros on this list, Qubes OS is the only one that is meant to be used as your main operating system. Qubes OS isn't just one Linux distro, it's many Linux
distros that are all layered on top of each other as different virtual machines. This insures security and privacy by way of separation. Everything from your Work, School,
Networking, Desktop Environment, and even TOR can be separated. The only issue with Qubes OS is that, because of its use of virtual machines, any Laptop/PC without at least
16GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores will be extremely slow, or just not run. To many in the Qubes OS community, it is known as 'Linux on hard mode', so you can expect to do some
troubleshooting. It is the only operating system that many people in OpSec trust, and it is one that you should trust too.

## Tails

Tails is far more popular than the other operating systems on this list, and that it for a good reason. It is super easy to use, and provides amazing anonymity. If you can
figure out how to boot from a USB, you can figure out how to use Tails. While you can use TOR on Qubes OS, Tails is specifically a live system meant for TOR. It leaves no
traces on your computer, and allows you to reach many non-clearweb sites. If you are looking for an OS where you can do anything restricted by your government or illegal,
Tails is the go-to.

## Whonix

Whonix is a nice middle ground between Tails and Qubes. If you are someone that uses onion services a lot, but aren't in enough danger/not paranoid enough to use Qubes,
Whonix is a great option. Whonix consists of not one, but two virtual machines. You have the gateway that routes all traffic through TOR, and the workstation where you
actually use your software. It runs better on old hardware that Tails & Qubes, and if you want you can even run a permanent non-vm system so that you have access to your
Gateway whenever you want.

# Conclusion

These are all great Linux distros depending on what you would like to do. I myself have used all of these Linux distros myself, and I've even written a blog about Qubes
OS. While they can sometimes be a pain, it is worth it, to protect your rights and stay anonymous. So I implore you, give one a try, and feel what the internet is like
without being tracked for a change.
