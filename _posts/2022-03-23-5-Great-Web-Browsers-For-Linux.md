Your browser is one of the most important pieces of software on your system. While it is not essential to having a working operating system, it is what will allow you to access all of your favorite sites in a safe and practical manner. So, it is important that you make the right choice on which browser you would like to use. If you are on the fence about what web browser you would like to use on your Linux system, I am going to give a rundown of my personal 5 favorite web browsers. It is also worth noting that while they may be available for other Operating systems, they are also all mainly focussed on Linux.

## IceCat

One of the oldest projects on this list, IceCat is a browser derived from Firefox, that is maintained by the GNU project. While it has gone through many different names, such as 'GNUZilla' and 'IceWeasel', it has always been committed to being a browser that protects your privacy and freedom. There is absolutely no Google or any type of nonfree code in IceCat. Plus, it comes installed with many extensions that will stop you from being tracked, including script blockers, fingerprinting countermeasures, and LibreJS, which blocks all nonfree javascript. If you care about freedom and privacy above all else, this is the right choice for you.

## BadWolf

This is one that you won't see on a lot of lists, but it is an amazing browser. It is very lightweight, yet extensible and easy to use. There are no extensions, it is still quite customizable with the use of CSS. It is one of the only true private, non-Firefox based web browsers. Being based on WebKitGTk+, it has a much smaller and more readable codebase than many other browsers, and all of the tabs are in isolated sessions that aren't aware of the other's existence. It takes some getting used to, but its anti-Mozila stance and dedication to having a small, private codebase is admirable.

## Otter

Opera is a very well known closed sourced web browser. If it's nonfree nature wasn't enough to ditch it, it has gotten considerably worse over the years. The Otter browser attempts to be what Opera used to be, but better. It is super fast, running QT WebEngine and it has very low resource usage. Yet, despite it being such a niche browser, it is very fully featured and super easy. It has RSS feeds, an amazing download manager, and even sticky notes. It's amazingly simple, and encapsulates what a browser really should be.

## Pale Moon

Pale Moon is the most popular browser currently on this list, and that is for good reason. It was based on an older version of Firefox, but is now built on their in house 'Gonna' toolkit. It is very fast, and has a nice 'old school' look to it. Don't worry though, if you don't like how it looks, Pale moon has many, many themes and extensions available.

## SeaMonkey

SeaMonkey is not only a web browser, it is actually a application suite that will cover all of your internet related needs. It comes with a HTML editor, EMail client, IRC client, and News reader. The actual browser is really just an older Firefox with a few tweaks, and it runs amazingly well. Seamonkey is just what you need if you really want to have a full application suite instead of just a browser.

# Conclusion

There are many browsers for Linux, but depending on how many resources your computer has, or what features you would like from your browser, these browsers will provide you with a great web browsing experience. While not typical, these web browsers are some of the best available right now. If you would like to use something that will suit your needs, or just want to be a hipster with a weird browser, I would check these out.
