This is not a post related to Linux, I just wanted to say that after running this blog for a long time, it was finally time to use an actual domain name. While this blog is still accessible through thekernalblog.github.io, you can now read all of my posts on thekernal.xyz. So, if any of you have this site bookmarked, you can feel free to change it to the new domain.
