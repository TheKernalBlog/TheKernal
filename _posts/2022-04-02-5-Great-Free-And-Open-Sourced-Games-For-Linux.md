To be honest, gaming sucks on Linux. While it is getting better, for most new games released, they either don't run on Linux, or run like crap. But, maybe instead of trying to run Linux like you would run Windows, you instead embrace the free and open source nature of Linux and play free and open sourced games. While there aren't many of them, there are some amazing games that you can enjoy while being ensured that your privacy and freedom is safe. If would like to play some great games, I am going to shine a light on some open sourced video games that will give you countless hours of entertainment.

## Xonotic
### FPS

Xonotic is a FPS that has a loyal, yet small amount of players. It is comparable to many other shooter games,. It has hundreds of maps, a wide variety of weapons, and an impressive amou
nt of servers. The movement is smooth and allows for a lot of skill. Plus, while it may seem that development is dead, there is a huge active userbase dedicated to modding the game, add
ing new weapons, gamemodes, and even vehicles. You can either get it from the package manager of your distro, or using this link.

## osu!
### Rhythm

Probably the most popular game on this list, osu! is a polished, unique, and competitive rhythm game. It has multiple modes, and due to its intuitive map creator, there is endless content created by the community. It even has a build directly for Linux that is packaged as an AppImage. You can download the AppImage right here.

## Minetest
### Sandbox

Minetest is what many people think of open sourced gaming. Minetest is essentially, a Minecraft clone that it completely free of any Microsoft code. While many of the main elements are very similar to Minecraft, it does have its own generation, ores, and progression. But before you begin to think that it is just some cheap clone, there are hundreds of mods and many, many servers. All of the servers are quite full, and they have diverse modsets.

It was forked from the original pixel dungeons, with many new features, weapons, and changes.

## 0AD
### Strategy

If you have ever played Civilization, you will love 0AD. Is it a very fast paced strategy game that is extremely addicting. There is an extensive campaign, and an insane amount of strategies and things to do. It is still under active development, and is still technically in Alpha. Yet, it is extremely polished and well created. While it is a bit niche, if you like those sorts of games it is something that you should really consider. Just check it out by clicking here.

# Conclusion

While the world of gaming is always going to be less than optimal for Linux users, there are a few great open sourced games that will allow you to have some fun gaming while not having to run any non-free software on your computer. As game publishers try to push us into a proprietary world, it is always important to have these software projects to keep the spirit of gaming with free software going. Plus, if you think that they suck, you can always just fork them and make your own version.
