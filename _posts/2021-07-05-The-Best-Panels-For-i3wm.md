So, you just installed i3, or any other window manager. You would like to use a panel with you window manager. There are many options, and you would like to choose the right one. Instead of rating these panels, I am going to list the best panels, their pro’s, and their cons. 

# i3bar

This is the bar that is going to come with the i3 window manager. It is very simple, coming with i3status, however it is good at what it does. It comes with the workspace switcher, and the ability to install other themes onto it to make it look better. I would recommend i3blocks. However, it does look ugly out of the box. 

# XFCE4-panel

This was not made for window managers, but I would be hard pressed to say that it does a bad job. It allows you to install custom applets, and customize it with just a gui. It is simple, and is what I would recommend to anyone who is new to ricing. It isn’t as good for customizing though. 

# Polybar

You may notice this as the one used by many ricers. It is one of the more complex ones, but it is very beautiful. You can do almost anything with it. You can really customize it any way that you want. However, it is very hard to use for the average user, and takes a lot of effort to customize. 

# Lemonbar

When I say that this is complex, I mean it. While Polybar has a small learning curve before you can customize, Lemonbar basically requires you to learn a whole new programming language. You have to make the bar completely from scratch. However, this can be good for the real power users that want to have everything exactly like they want it. 

While these are not your only options, if you are going to use a panel with i3, it will most likely be one of these four. While I personally use Polybar, there are pros and cons to both and you should pick the one that is right for you.
