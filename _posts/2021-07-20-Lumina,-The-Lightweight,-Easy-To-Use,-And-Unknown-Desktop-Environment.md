There are many desktop environments now. With Xfce, LXDE, Cinnamon, Mate, Gnome, and Budgie, there are just so many options. However, there is a new major player in the desktop environment world. Lumina. It is a fast, minimal, and very customizable desktop environment. While it is not in many of the official repos, I still think that it is a great choice of desktop for any user. 

# Speed 

Lumina is a very fast desktop environment. It uses the FluxBox window manager, so you already know that it is going to be fast. From my experience, it used around 200mb at the most when booting up. I would say that it is comparable to LXQT or LXDE in terms of speed. It is good for anyone that has a low end computer that has trouble running something like Gnome. 

# Applications 

Lumina is the polar opposite to something like KDE. While KDE comes with a lot of applications, there is almost nothing that comes with Lumina. It comes with a search tool, a file manager, and a screenshot tool. Apart from the desktop itself, that’s about it. This is good for anyone who has low disk space on their computer, or just likes being able to install all of their own applications. 

# Customization 

I am a big fan of customization. Lumina is one of the easiest desktops to customize apart from maybe Cinnamon and KDE. It has a few built in themes, and it is easy to change the icons, and the windows by using the fluxbox configuration tool. There are also some widgets that are very easy to move around, add, and remove. It is great for anyone who wants the feel of KDE widgets, without it eating up all of your RAM. 

# Menu

The menu for Lumina is one of the most feature packed out of any of the desktop environments. It has a simple pipe menu, like what you would get with openbox, and a static menu that you can place on a panel. You can use a traditional menu system, or a alphabetical list of all your applications. There is a search tool to aid you with finding any applications that you might be having trouble with. The favorites section shows your favorite files, applications, and directories, allowing you to find anything that you use frequently. 

# Conclusion 

Overall, Lumina is a great desktop for anyone that wants something Fast, Minimal, and easy to use. While it is not as intuitive as heavier desktop environments, it makes customizing it easy and intuitive, so you will be able to mold it to however you like it. In most cases on Linux you will have to build it from source, but it is fairly easy to do so, and it is available using the “pkg” package manager on BSD systems. I had a lot of fun using it, and would recommend that you give it a try.
