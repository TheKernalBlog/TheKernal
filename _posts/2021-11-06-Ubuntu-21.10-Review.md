Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distro's of all time. It is oriented twords 
people who have little to none Linux experience. Instead of a rolling release distro like 
Arch, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, or Void it has many seperate releases. The newest release is Ubuntu 'Impish Indri' 21.10. 
Just to test it out, I installed it on a spare drive and played around with it a bit, even using it to 
write my previous blog. I am going to go over the changes that I have seen, and my experience with this 
new-ish version of Ubuntu. 

# Speed 

As is the stereotype, it was very bloated. Even on my average hardware, it was quite slow. Nothing compared to windows, but I could notice some stuttering and freezes. 
I noticed that opening apps, even apps that are regular .deb packages like the Gnome terminal opened slowly. Some of the problems with the desktop were fixed by switching to 
Xorg, but the slow startup times for apps persisted.  

# Snaps 

This is the main reason that people have been hating on Ubuntu. They have made their own package manager called snapd. Many people, including me, have a real problem with 
these packages. One of the main resons that people have for hating them are that they are super slow. Now that Firefox is packaged as a Snap, it took about 10 seconds to launch. 
When I uninstalled it as a snap and used apt to install the .deb package, it usually launched in 2-3 seconds. While some people may not see that as a huge difference, when you are 
opening Firefox to research and surf the internet a lot, it really sucks. Not to mention that snaps are proprietary, and as someone who really cares about freedom and privacy, 
that is a huge problem. 

# Package availability 

Because Ubuntu is the most popular desktop distributions, you are going to be able to get any software that you could ever need. Even closed-source software. While I can see how this
could be good for a beginer, it really defeats the whole purpouse of being an open-sourced operating system when you are going to ship with and have nonfree software in your 
repositories. I personally like the approach of Debian more, not shipping with non-free software by default in its repo's, but allowing you to add the repository yourself. There is no 
reason that Ubuntu can't add a little switch in their software center for adding nonfree repo's if you really need or want nonfree software. 

# Insillation 

Once I actually booted the LiveCD, the instillation was super smooth and easy. But actually flashing the thing was a pain. I usually use DD for flashing USB sticks, it's a simple 
command line tool that does it's job well. However, when I tried to do this with the Ubuntu ISO, it failed. So, I went with my second option, I used BalenaEtcher, which has had a 
100% success rate with other distro's, and the verifacation failed. I looked online, found that Unetbootin worked, and tried that. That finally worked, I have no clue what they did 
to make the iso so crappy, but there is no reason that they should have done this. 

# Conclusion 

This new release is one of the worst Ubuntu releases in a while. If you were going to use Ubuntu, I would reccomend that you stay on 21.04, and either wait for some of the problems to 
be fixed, or consider switching to Debian Sid. All of the good of Ubuntu with none of the problems. If all of this isn't a deal breaker for you, feel free to use it, but personally I 
would reccomend staying FAR FAR away.
