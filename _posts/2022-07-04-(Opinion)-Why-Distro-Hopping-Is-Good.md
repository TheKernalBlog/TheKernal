Distro hopping is often seen as a sort of sickness. Something that you should strive to stop. But why is that? Many Linux experts have done it, and it doesn't seem to have done any harm. In fact, I happen to believe that distro hopping is something that, while you shouldn't probably continue to do forever, is deeply beneficial to anyone attempting to learn Linux. So, I will go through some reasons why you, yes **you**, should consider distro hopping.

# You Can Find The Perfect Distro

Every Linux user has their perfect Linux distribution. This is a distro that fits their workflow and fills their requirements perfectly. For many people, this may be the first Linux distro that they ever try, but more often than not, it requires trial and effort. Much like articles of clothing, you have to properly *try on* a Linux distro before you can be sure that it fits. And maybe, it'll take a long time to find the distro you really want to stick with, but it will ensure that you will eventually find the one you enjoy the most.

# You can Help Other Linux Users

In the Linux community, it is always a good experience when you head over to a forum and are able to help people out. And if you would like to help people out, there is no better way to get an intimate experience with their operating system that actually using it yourself. Simply put, by trying out and using so many Linux distros, you are arming yourself with the knowledge to help more people.

# It's Fun!

While many people would not consider installing a new operating system onto your computer "fun", you can't dismiss it as a pretty entertaining way to kill some time. Installing and setting up a new system is exciting, and it's a nice experience trying out all of the new applications and features on your system.

# Distro's Fall Behind

You aren't always going to be able to try out the newest features and desktop environments on your current distro. For example, I switched to Pop<sub>OS</sub>! simply because of the [COSMIC](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic) desktop environment. Sometimes your distro just won't be able to provide you with the brand new things that you really want, and in that case, it is better to jump ship to something that will improve your computing experience.

# It's Harmless

If done corectly, there is absolutely no way that distro hopping is detrimental to your computer, files, or life in the slightest. As long as you keep your user files on a separate partition, manually partition the disk at install, and mount the partition as home, you can completely re-install without loosing any of your personal files. With a separate home partition, you can install 500 different OS's, while preserving your home directory the entire time.

# Conclusion

Personally, distro hopping is what got me really interested in the inner workings of Linux, and is a big part of the reason that I started this blog in the first place. It's something that a lot of Linux users will and **should** do to get a good feel for all of the Linux distros, before eventually finding one to settle down with. And if none of these reasons convince you to distro hop a little bit, just think about how more informed you will be when you tell someone online that their distro sucks after actually giving it a try on real hardware.
