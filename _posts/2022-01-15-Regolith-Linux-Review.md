One of the most common criticisms of tiling window managers is that they are hard to use, and on that, I would agree. Installing, setting up, and theming tiling window managers is usually a big task. But does it have to be that way? Regolith doesn't seem to think that should be the case. Regolith combines the power of i3 with the ease of use that comes with GNOME, Regolith allows people to gain the productivity features you would get using a tiling window manager. I tried out Regolith for a day in KVM with Gpu-passthrough and I am going to give my opinions on this distro and desktop environmentis usually a big task. But does it have to be that way?

# Instillation 

Regolith is both a Linux distro and a desktop environment. I found the regular instillation with the ISO super easy, it is Ubuntu after all. A few mouse clicks and it was done. It is also super easy to install the desktop on other distro's. By going to  [This link](https://regolith-linux.org/download/)you can find the ppa for Ubuntu. You can also install the desktop from the AUR on Arch Linux. 

# Ease of use

As someone who is already accustomed to tiling window managers, I found it super easy and fluid to use. However that doesn't mean that it is just for tiling window manager pro's, as it explains all of the keyboard shortcuts to you so that you can get to using it right away. You also don't have to worry about writing an Xrander shell script, or settings a wallpaper and lockscreen with an external application, as all of those things can be done with the GNOME settings manager that comes pre-installed. Configuring this thing is super easy. 

# Configuration 

I was able to do a lot of configuration with Regolith, and only had to touch the config file once to move the bar to the top. Otherwise, everything can be done using the package manager and preset themes. For example, using the package manager you can install plenty of, "looks", which will follow a certian colorscheme and change the GTK, Icon, Window manager, and terminal themes. I find not having to scower the internet for various themes for components and being able to install one binary liberating. You can also change what is on the bar by installing and uninstalling "i3rocks" components. By simply installing the binary for everything from time to weather, they will be automatically added to your bar. I personally liked this approach a lot better than having one config file.

# Conclusion 

Whether you are a seasoned tiling window manager veteran or a complete newbie, I cant help but reccomend Regolith. It is something that the Linux world has been needing for a while now, a true tiling desktop environment, and it is one of the most pleasent, easy to configure, and fast desktop environments that I've ever used. So please, try it out in a VM, or even install it on your system if you think that it sounds like something that you would like.
