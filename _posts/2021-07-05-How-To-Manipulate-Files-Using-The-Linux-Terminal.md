The Linux terminal can be used for many things. Launching applications, downloading software, and a lot more. However, one of the best uses of the terminal is for managing files. Linux has many commands that allows you to manipulate, and manage files right from the terminal. I am going to list all of these so that you may be able to manage files without anything other than the terminal. 

# cd

Cd allows you to change “directories”. Directories are like the “folders” of Linux. They are where you can put files and other directories. For example, if I wanted to switch to the Documents directory, I could type this. 

Cd Documents. 

# ls

This allows you to list the files in the current directory. You need to be able to know the names of the files is you want to use/manipulate. This lists the files and directories. You can use ls -a to list all of the hidden files too. 

# rm

This allows you to remove files. This can be achieved by typing 

rm /path/to/filename

If you would like to remove a directory, you can do the same thing by typing rm -r. 

#cp

This is the command that allows you to copy files. To copy files simply type this in the terminal. 

Cp /original/pathto/filename /path/to/copy/to

# mv

This is the command that allows you to move files. It is simmaler to the cp command, but it moves instead of copying. To move using this command, type this in the terminal

mv original/pathto/filename /path/to/move/to

# mkdir 

This allows you to make a directory in the current directory that you are in. If you would like to use this command to make a directory, type this in your terminal. 

Mkdir “name of directory you want to make”

Now you will be able to move, copy, create, and remove files and directories. This will allow you to have a better understanding of how your computer works, and help you in the future for any sort of troubleshooting or running/building software.
