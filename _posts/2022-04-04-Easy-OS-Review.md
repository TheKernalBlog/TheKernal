It really seems like all of the container software available right now is super bloated. You install something in a docker container, and you are suddenly using all of your 
resources. But, it seems like we are all in luck, because now, there is EasyOS. EasyOS is a new, Puppy-Linux based operating system that is built on their own "Easy" containers. 
I decided to give it a try, and I am going to give my opinions on the various features and apps in EasyOS.  

## Containers 

The main feature of EasyOS is the containers. And man, they really are great. I have no clue how they pulled it off, but the dev team managed to cut the RAM usage to less than a 
single MB. Also, unlike other containers, all of your containers are easily managed with a simple, albeit a little ugly GUI application. It really is an amazing feat, and I just wish
that it is available on other distros, because I see a real future for Easy containers. 

## Instillation 

Easy OS, like Puppy Linux, does not have an ISO available. The only way to use it is as a .img file, where it can be run as a persistent live image. However, if you would like to 
install it on your hard drive, again, like Puppy Linux, you can do a frugal install to boot from your Hard Disk. The install process was a little complicated, and I would like to 
see something akin to Anaconda or Calamares, because the current install program is a little clunky, and at one point for me, froze entirely. 

## Desktop 

The desktop is nothing to write home about, but I would not say that it is bad in the slightest. It is certianly focused on speed over eye candy, but it does not look super ugly 
either. EasyOS uses the JWM-ROX desktop, which, as you can imagine, is the same desktop that is used by Puppy Linux. The layout of the desktop is increadebly close to the 
traditional Windows or KDE look, with a start button, window list, and system tray in that order. 

## No Systemd

While personally, it is not a huge issue for me if a distro has Systemd or not, it is worth noting that EasyOS does not use it. In fact, they use Busybox to start the system. While 
it is a bold choice, I think that it is a good one because I am reporting boot times of about 2-5 seconds on my HHD. 

## Package Instillation & Updates 

EasyOS uses the pup package format, which is no surprise. Much like everything else in this distro, the package manager is a GUI tool that is made to be simple and fast. But, what 
is a surprise, is that there is a simple and easy way to update. While it is like Puppy Linux with its Atomic upgrades, instead of having to do it manually EasyOS has a simple tool 
that will cut out all the hard work. 

# Conclusion 

EasyOS is a very innovative, very fast, and quite frankly, Easy Linux distro. Easy containers truly have great potential, and the distro itself is unique and amazing. If you like 
containers and the greatness that they provide, with the new, super efficent code from the Easy team, I would highly recommend trying EasyOS out.
