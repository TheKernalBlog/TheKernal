There are many window managers. Tiling, floating, and all purpose window managers are insanely popular. I am going to list three of the most popular floating window managers, and what you should consider when picking what one to choose. I am only going to be covering floating window managers, so no tiling. However, there is still a lot to talk about, so let’s get into it. 

# OpenBox

This is the most popular of the floating window managers. It is also one of the fastest. In my experience, requiring less than 400mb of RAM. This also means that is is very minimalist. When you install openbox, all that you will see is a black screen with a pipe menu. However, Obconf, and editing the config file means that you can make openbox beautiful. 

# IceWM

IceWM is a window manager that is getting more of a audience. It is fast, on par with openbox. It comes with a panel, that can be configured, or removed. It is also very easy to theme. Simply go to box-look.org and install one of the many themes. Having a panel, and being easy to customize makes it a good middle ground between openbox and the window manager we are about to talk about. 

# FluxBox

FluxBox, is still very fast when compared to a traditional desktop environment. However, it is slightly slower than OpenBox and IceWm. It is a good option for someone who doesn’t want to go through as much work editing the config file. There is a reason that it ships with MXLinux. It is fast enough, while still being able to customize easily.

I am not going to tell you what window manager you should use. I think that these three are some of the best if you prefer a floating window manager that you can customize. I think that these are all great alternatives to a desktop environment. So feel free to choose the one that you think suits your needs. Even if it is not one that it on the list.
