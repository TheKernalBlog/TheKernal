What desktop environment do you use? Most likely you use Gnome, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, or maybe something that isn’t as popular like Budgie. There is a new deskotp environment that is on the block. It is called “CuteFish”. It is a QT based desktop enviornment that is super user friendly. I am going to go over where you can get it, what it looks like, and what it’s features are. 

# Where is it?

I would say that the best way to get a great experience with this desktop is ‘CuteFishOS’. CuteFishOS is based on Ubuntu, yet there is no easy way to get it on actuall Ubuntu or Debian. However, you can install it on Arch Linux and any of the derivitives like Manjaro or Endeavour OS. It is only available in the AUR and you can’t install it with just the Pacman Package Manager. 

# What Does It Look Like? 

CuteFish takes HEAVY inspiration from MacOS. It has a simaler icon theme look, it has the signature 2 panel layout of MacOS, and the theming will remind anyone who has had experience with MacOS about the rounded and flat look. It even goes as far as having the options for the window decorations on the panel. It uses QT, partially due to the fact that they use a lot of the same code from KDE. 

# What Features Does It Come With? 

It comes with a whole range of apps. They remind me of the Gnome apps, in that they are simple and super easy to use. They include a terminal, file manager, application launcher, camera, settings manager, and everything else that you could ever need. The only real problem is tht the applications are not very themeable, and many of them are lacking important features. 

# Conclusion 

CuteFish is a very small project that I would not recommend using as a desktop for most people. It can be something that would be good for someone who has never used anything other than a Mac . I find it very charming and the apps super easy to use, but you can pretty easilly replicate it using a faster, more customizable desktop like Budgie or KDE.
