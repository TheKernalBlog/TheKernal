Hello! You may notice that the website has gone through some changes. I have completely moved the entire website from the standard [Jeckyl Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to the sleeker, faster, more feature packed [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). This is a substantial change. However, I do believe that this new look will not only make the website easier to navigate, but more professional. If you have any questions or concerns about this change, please feel free to [Email](mailto:TheKernalBlog@Protonmail.com) me.
