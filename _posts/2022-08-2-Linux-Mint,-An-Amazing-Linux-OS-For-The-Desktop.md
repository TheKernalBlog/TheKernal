The last time I had used Linux Mint before I started researching for this blog was around 2018, where I was using the Ubuntu 16.04 base and the XFCE desktop. And, despite being very happy with it, I have never used it since. Although, I
have recommended it to a great many people online and in real life. So, out of sheer curiosity, I decided to give it another whirl. And After installing it in KVM, and playing around with it for around 30 minutes, I have to say, It's better
So, to bring you up to speed on this incredible operating system, I'll give you a rundown of Linux Mint's Performance, Appearance, Software Management, and some
incredibly useful apps made by the Linux Mint Team.

# Performance


<a id="org8a951cb"></a>

## My Specs

-   4 GB of RAM
-   4 CPU Cores
-   No GPU

## RAM Usage

With the Cinnamon Desktop Environment, I am averaging 610MB of RAM used on a cold boot, without any apps open. Not bad for a desktop environment boasting so many fancy effects.

## CPU Usage

CPU usage, too, was quite good. Again, on a cold boot, I am achieving 3-5% total CPU usage, split pretty evenly between all 4 cores.

## Boot-up time

After realizing that the boot up speed is decently fast I decided to measure that as well. Without any additional services, I record a speed of 15 seconds flat, which is pretty good for a fully fledged
distro like Linux Mint.

# Appearance

Cinnamon is not as snazzy as something as GNOME 42, but really, it doesn't have to be. The icons, while not what you usually see nowadays, are very readable and aesthetically pleasing. The themes are also
very easy on the eyes, and seems like a good middle ground between the flat, round look [Adwiata](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Adwiata-(design-language)) and the sharp, layered look of [Breeze](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/BreezeStyleSheets). And much like Ubuntu 22.04, you can easily change the accent colors
the settings, which effects not only the GTK theme, but the icon theme as well.

# Cinnamon Settings

Due to the fact that Linux Mint uses mainly GNOME apps, I was convinced that they were
going to use the GNOME settings app as well. So it was a pleasent surprise when I opened the 'Cinnamon Control Center' and found something completely different. The Cinnamon Control
Center has a staggering amount of things to configure, (I counted 42), and the tools you're provided within the Control Center are extremely powerful, rivaled only by KDE.

# WebApp Manager

The WebApp Manager is another app created by Linux Mint, but usable in almost every Linux distro. It does just what it says on the tin, managing Web Apps. You can select your choice of
browser, what name you would like the Web App to have, the icon, and of course, the link to the website itself. From there, you can open the app menu and interact your web app in the same
way that you would a regular application.

# TimeShift

TimeShift is an application that I have written about before. And that is for good reason. TimeShift, apart from Snapper on SUSE, is the fastest and easiest to use backup utility currently available.
You can make a filesystem backup at any time, or you can set a schedule. You even get to choose which directories you would like to back up. You can choose to include or exclude your *, /home*, and /boot, so
that when you roll back you can keep any files or configurations that you really need.

# Software Management


<a id="org60f4587"></a>

## Synaptic

Ol' Reliable. Synaptic is a very old, very stable, and very tested front end for apt. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, apart from the fact that there is very dated, confusing to new users, and a
little ugly.


<a id="org2a3a6cb"></a>

## GNOME Software

When I first used Linux Mint, GNOME Software was not installed by default, so it is nice to see that they've changed their minds. It's new, modern, and launches reasonably fast. GNOME Software is a great
addition that will help new users get acclimated to Linux without having to use the terminal.


<a id="orgb5ecc80"></a>

## Update Manager

Technically, Update Manager **is** Synaptic, but it is labeled as a different app in the menu, so I will count it as a seperate app as well. Update Manager appears as both a app in the app menu, and a applet
in the system tray. When you need updates, the applet will transform from a full 'Sheild' to only half, alerting you. Then, once you click on it, you will be brought to synaptic, which will list all of the
packages that need updates. From there, you can click on the check mark, type in your password, and wait for the update to be over.

# Conclusion

Linux Mint has done a beautiful job at creating a desktop operating system that is simple enough for complete newbies, and powerful enough for any person with extensive Linux knowledge
to be content using it. Its mix of traditional desktop metaphors, GUI apps for everything, and new innovations that makes Linux Mint an exelent competitor to Microsoft Windows. If there
ever was a single distro that you should recommend to non-Linux users, Linux Mint is it.
