I have a very special place in my heart for PopOS. It was my second ever Linux distro. It is amazing for beginners and gamers. Now that Ubuntu has released 21.04, Pop OS was bound to upgrade. I think, that they have been going on a great direction. They have made their own desktop environment, and it has had some amazing improvements. I am going to go over them, and why you might want to use their new desktop. 

Their desktop Cosmic, was made to fill the void that Gnome 40 left. It does a great job at doing it too. It is a lot like Gnome, with a panel at the bottom. If you do not like it, you can move it to the side, autohide it, or just remove it. It also comes with a smaller app launcher, which is good for anyone that is transitioning from Windows/MacOS. 

It is also much more speedy and customizable than Gnome. While Gnome seems like it is fighting against your ability to customize, Cosmic allows you to do it without any of the fuss of installing any software or extensions. It also comes with windows that have the minimize and maximize button, which is good news for any newbies. 

If you are someone who is not experienced with Linux, or just want something that will work for gaming out of the box, I would recommend PopOS. The Cosmic desktop has taken this Linux distro from being good to amazing.
