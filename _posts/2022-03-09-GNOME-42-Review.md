GNOME is by far the most popular Linux desktop environment. 3 of the biggest distros,
Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian all use GNOME as their default. So, it is a big deal that
GNOME is planning to release GNOME 42. Well, I decided to give it a test run, and I
am going to explain what makes this new release different.

## Performance

While with GNOME 40, most of the memory and CPU problems were addressed, the GPU
performance left something to be desired. But, now, with GNOME 42, they have introduced
triple frame buffer support, which is a big boost for Intel graphics and Raspberry Pi's
. Plus, with GTK4's GPU acceleration, every single app feels much more smooth and
Epiphany is now considered as a better choice for a browser.

## LibAdwiata

The most striking change in GNOME 42 is LibAdwiata. While it is somewhat controversial,
it is, in my opinion, a great change. It looks much more modern than the old Adwiata
theme, and seems to have more contrast to help people with disabilities. It allows
developers to be in control of how their apps look and not have distros break apps
with their custom themes.

## New Screenshot UI

GNOME shell now has a brand new screenshot tool build directly in. It is not only very
slick and good looking, but also has screen recording built in. So, now you don't have
to worry about setting up OBS or Ffmpeg to screen record. It is an amazing change that
will save a lot of people a lot of time when trying to set up screen recording.

## Brand new apps

While GNOME Terminal and Gedit are not going away for a while, their replacements,
"Console" and "Gnome Text Editor " are going to be released with GNOME 42. While they
do not boast a lot of new features, they do have some new configuration options and
new UI. The new text editor has some exciting new features which make a great option
for someone isn't quite ready for something like Vim or Emacs, but wants something
powerful and extensible.

## Shell changes

The actual GNOME shell has gone through some small changes too. The rounded corners
on the top bar were removed for a small increase in performance, and the arrows that
would appear when you bring down the menu's on the top bar were also removed. The biggest change seems to be the volume and brightness indicators were shrinked and
moved to the bottom of the screen, which is much less distracting.

# Conclusion

While I do not use GNOME and have no intention of using it, this new update is going
to make the experience much better for GNOME users, and by extension make desktop
Linux better in general. It seems like by introducing LibAdwiata and some quality
of life improvements, they are on a mission to make desktop Linux more approachable
and polished than Windows and MacOS combined. If you were thinking of introducing
Linux to a new user, consider waiting t'ill GNOME 42 is officially released, because
it will blow their socks off.
