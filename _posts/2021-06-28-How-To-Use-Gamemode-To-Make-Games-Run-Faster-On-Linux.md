If you are gaming on linux, 
you might have less than optimal performance when gaming. 
You might think that there is no way to improve your performance, 
but there is. It is called gamemode. 
gamemode is free and open sourced. 
It allows you to boost your performance by optimizing the OS for gaming. 
I am going to go over how to install, 
and use gamemode too boost your gaming performance. 

You can install gamemode on almost every linux distro. 
Simply type these lines in the terminal 
depending on what distro you are using.  

Debian/Ubuntu: 

sudo apt-get install gamemode

Arch/Manjaro: 

yay -S gamemode

RedHat/Fedora: 

sudo dnf -y install gamemode

OpenSUSE: 

sudo zypper install gamemode

Now that you have it installed, you have to use it with Lutris. If you are gaming on Linux you probably have Lutris anyways. To enable it, simply go to preferences in Lutris. Go to system options and click the switch that says, “enable feral gamemode”. If you have an old version of Lutris (Debian) then go to preferences, system options, and type “gamemoderun” in the command prefix box. 

When you boot up a game in lutris, you should now have substantially better performance due to gamemode. If you have a bad computer, or just want more FPS, I would highly reccomend that you do this so that you can more efficiently use your machine for gaming.
