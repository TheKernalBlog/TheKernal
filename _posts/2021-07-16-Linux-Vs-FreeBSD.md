Linux and FreeBSD are both open sourced operating systems that are built off of unix. They are very simmaler to one another. Linux is very widely used, taking about 2.68% of the marker share currently. However, FreeBSD is gaining popularity. I am going to go over the differences between the two kernals, and what one you should use. 

# Linux 

A lot of people say that Linux is not a operating system on its own. It is more like a kernal. While I disagree, Linux, by itself is a lot less featured than something like FreeBSD. It is a bit slower and less secure than BSD, but the fact that is is so popular means that it can be used by almost anyone. Managing packages in linux varies heavily on what “Distro” that you choose to use. While Linux on it’s own is less fully featured, the many Linux “Distros” make it a lot easier to use than FreeBSd, while being slightly slower and less secure. 

# FreeBSD	

FreeBSD is a very full featured operating system. Unlike linux, it only has one real package manager, pkg. It is lighter than linux, so it will take up less performance and space. Due to the fact that there is only one real package manager, the packages that you install are going to be super trustworthy. While it looses is available software, it makes up for it in stability, and speed. 

I personally use Linux. However, I would recommend that everyone try out BSD. I think that for the average person, Linux is a lot better, BSD may just be the thing for you. If you want a faster more secure operating system, at the cost of less usability, I think that BSD is for you. However, if you want something that has good support and is easier to use, you should stick with Linux.
