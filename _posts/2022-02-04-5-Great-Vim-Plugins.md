Vim is one of, if not the most popular text editor among Linux users, when it comes to coding, editing configuration files, and generally writing on the command line, vim is the go to. Hell, I'm writing this in vim right now. So, in order to improve the experience, vim has many plugins that you can install to add features or change how things work. Excluding colorschemes, I am going to explain 5 of the best vim plugins that I personally use, and how they could improve your vim experience.

# Surround 

Vim is mainly used by coders, so it can suck that you have to manually deal with brackets, XML tags, and quotes. I personally find this quite helpful when writing I am writing in HTML or even markdown. If you use vim for coding, I find this plugin a must-have. You can look at the github for Surround by clicking the link below.

# NERD Tree 

Like the name may suggest, NERD Tree is a plugin that allows you to manage files from within vim, using a file tree. No longer do you have to look for the file using basic UNIX commands, you can just toggle NERD Tree and get to the file you would like to edit in seconds. If you would like a more complete vim-like file managing experience, I would look into ranger, but if you just want to move around and open some files in vim, NERD Tree is the way to go. Click the link below to install it.

# Airline 

The bottom bar in vim is quite useful, but it is also quite ugly. There is a way to make it better, and that is by installing airline. Not only is it faster than many of the alternatives, it displays some extra information, plus, it supports color schemes if you would like it to match your theme. It really just serves to make vim a lot more appealing, and more on par with GUI apps. The link below will bring you to the github page where you can install it.

# Dev icons 

Many developers write in more than one coding language, and you will notice that in any GUI file manager there are different icons depending on the file type. So, it makes sense that you would like to have that in vim. Simply by installing any Nerd font, any coding language viewed by any sort of plugin, like NERD Tree or airline, will show a icon depending on the file type or coding language. If you have a bunch of scripts and programs that you are writing, dev icons is really great to distinguish your projects. Just click below to install this nice plugin.

# VimCompletesMe

Tab autocompletion is great for typing out long strings of code that you have used already, or a super long word. Many people automatically just press tab assuming that it will autocomplete the word for them. VimCompletesMe allows for you to use this amazing functionality. Just follow the link below if you would like to install it.

# Conclusion 

Aside from emacs, vim probably has the most plugins of any text editor, and these plugins are one of the things that really sells people on vim. Simply by configuring and installing some plugins, you can suit vim to your liking. So, I emplore you, be like me, make vim more bloated than gedit with 1000 plugins.
