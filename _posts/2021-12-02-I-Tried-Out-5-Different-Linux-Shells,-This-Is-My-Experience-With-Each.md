I want you to think about what terminal shell you use, if you haven’t changed it, it is most likely that you use Bash. While Bash is the one that most Linux distro’s use, there are may other shells that have their own unique features. For the purposes of testing, I used 5 different shells, and I am going to give a review of the Bash, Fish, Zsh, Dash, and Ksh Shells. 

# Bash

This is the default, industry standard shell. Which means that there are going to be bash scripts that will not work on any other shell. While it is not the fastest shell, it not slow either, and balances well between the amount of features and speed. It has such useful features like history, the ability to autostart programs, and tab autocompletion. 

# Fish

Fish is the shell that I am currently using, and it is hard to find a Linux distro where Fish is the default. Despite that, it is still one of the most popular shells, because it is just so easy to configure. You can configure fish with a easy GUI browser page. Plus, it just looks great with the auto completion features. The plugin support is also better than Zsh in my opinion. 

# Zsh

You may know Zsh as the default shell for FreeBSD, and by extension, MacOS. It was a good choice too. It is a very customizable and easy to use shell. It has all of the features that you would find with bash, and more. It has automatic cd, so you just have to type the name of the directory that you would like to cd into, and it has a feature where it will detect spelling errors and fix them automatically. It also has excellent plugin support. 

# Dash 

Dash is the absolute opposite of Fish. It tries to have as little features as possible. It tries to emulate the experience of the original UNIX shell, and comes with no features. No tab auto completion, no themes, no nothing. It is just a simple shell prompt, and nothing more. This shell is blazing fast and super easy to use.

# Ksh 

Ksh is the shell that is used by OpenBSD, and was originally used by AT&T Unix. Despite the fact that it requires more disk space than other shells, it provides better performance without having to compromise on features. Except for the Dash shell, Ksh was the fastest shell that I used which is great considering that it has almost the exact same features as bash. 

# Conclusion 

As you can see, there are many great terminal shells that all fall into their own little niche, and would serve your system well. Your choice in shell can make a world of difference in speed and usability if you are an avid user of the terminal. So I encourage you to try out some different shells, just for a little bit, because you might find one that fits your needs better.
