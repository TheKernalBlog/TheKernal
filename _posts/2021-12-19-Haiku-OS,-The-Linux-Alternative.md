When you think of alternatives to Linux, you most likely are thinking of BSD, MacOS, or even Hurd. One such OS that people don't recommend nearly as often is HaikuOS. HaikuOS is an amazing OS that is based off of the old now defunct BeOS. I am going to go over the instillation, hardware support, desktop, and package availability for HaikuOS. 

# Instillation 

I found the instillation quite pleasant. It reminded me of the old Windows installers, but much faster and easier to use. Because I have a UEFI laptop, I had to manually make a EFI partition and mount it, so expect to do some partitioning yourself if you have a relatively recent computer. In terms of speed, HaikuOS was even faster than the BSD family. It finished in around 2.5 minutes, which is super impressive. 

# Hardware support 

While I was going into HaikuOS thinking that the hardware support was going to be god awful because of the small team, but I was very surprised. With Linux-Libre, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD not supporting my trackpad and WiFi card, it is amazing that HaikuOS supported all of my hardware perfectly. When talking to other people who have used it, they all say the same thing. So you can try it out without having to worry about a WiFi adapter or recompiling your kernel. 

# Desktop 

I found the retro look and feel of the desktop an amazing experience. There are many cool things you can do with the Windows, like moving them together to have them as one window switching between them with tabs, and binding them together to have them essentially 'glued' together. You can tell that the desktop was designed perfectly to save screen space, as there is only one small menu at the top right. You also have the choice to put widgets on the desktop, which makes up for the lack of panel. 

# Package availability 

This is the main reason that I would stay away from HaikuOS. If you thought that BSD, or even Linux had too little software availability, you are going to hate HaikuOS. It is good for daily tasks, like browsing the web, responding to emails, and writing. If you need to do any gaming or use proprietary software, you are extremely out of luck. One of the good things about the package manager is that if you have a 32 bit CPU, you can use all of the apps that were designed for the original BeOS. 

# Conclusion 

While I wouldn't recommend it to most people, HaikuOS is a great OS for an old computer, or someone who is just going to use their computer for nothing other than simple tasks. It is some great BeOS nostalgia for someone who is old and rich enough to have owned a BeBox, or someone who bought BeOS back in the olden days. If you would like to test it out for yourself, please try it out on a virtual machine or run either the live or installed mode on real hardware.
