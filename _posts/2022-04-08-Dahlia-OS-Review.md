Google. Simply saying the name is enough to give some shivers down their spine. While they have
been quite fundamental to the sucess of Linux, they are known for being a evil, privacy 
destroying company. But, thankfully, they are known to make many of the components of their 
operating systems open sourced. While there are many open sourced distributions of Android,
for the longest time, it didn't seem like there wasn't any equivalient for ChromeOS. That was 
t'ill now. Dahlia OS is a open sourced, Fuchsia based, Linux distro with its own desktop, apps,
and package repository. I personally gave it a whirl, and I would like to share my experience 
with you, so you might consider giving it a try. 

## Pangolin 

Pangolin is a very full featured, easy to configure, and fast desktop. It is almost identical 
to Chrome OS, with some small changes and more configuration options. It uses the beautiful 
Material design scheme, with some beautiful animations. In the settings, lies a 'Customization'
tab, that allows you to fully customize the colors and wallpaper.

## Speed

For something as fancy and beautiful as Pangolin, you'd think that DahliaOS would be a 
resource hog. Yet, it is incredibly lightweight. With my testing on a KVM virtual machine 
that had 4GB of ram and 6 CPU cores, used about 210mb of ram and 1-2% of the CPU when idle. 
Plus, the image itself is less than 200mb, which is super impressive. 

## Graft 

While most of the apps in Dahlia are not very exciting, by design they are meant to be simple 
and fast. Yet, there is one that deserves mention. Graft is an app that allows you to create
Linux virtual machines and containers. It runs great, and in my opinion, totally makes up for
the sad lack of native flutter-based applications. 

# Conclusion 

DahliaOS is not the most feature packed, mature, or practical operating system out right now. 
Yet, it has a lot of potential. With a few more years of development, and some more funding,
I truly believe that it will be one of, if not the best operating system available. So, while
Google may still be the devil, some good can still come out of their wickedness.
