There are a few things that don’t seem like they would go together well, and yet they do. Ice cream and fries, Chocolate and Potato Chips, there are many weird combinations that some people will throw out before even considering. One of those is CentOS on the desktop. CentOS, (Community Enterprise Operating System) is a very server focused OS that is mainly run by independents and small businesses to host their servers. However, with the release of CentOS stream, I have been giving it a try, and using it on my desktop. I am going to give a general review of the things that I really like about this amazing distro, especially when it comes to desktop usage. 

# Instillation 

The Instillation was a breeze. If you have ever installed Fedora or RHEL before you will get the gist of how the installation went. It was very easy. The software selection was amazing, you could choose between a desktop version with a desktop and a lot of the essentials, a minimal instillation with just a desktop, and a server installation with no GUI. Whether you want everything already installed for you, or if you want to manually install the GUI by yourself, all of the options are there for you. The team 
has versions for both KDE and GNOME. 

# Stability 

This is the main reason that people want to use CentOS. For stability. That is why it is such a great Linux distro for servers. This is also a plus if you are using it as a desktop. While the older software can be a hindrance for gaming, if you are just using your machine for work or web browsing, it means that you can choose not to update for a while and not break your system. While some people may say that the switch to stream makes it less stable, I would argue that the slow stream of updates instead of one huge upgrade whenever a new version of RHEL comes out makes it more stable and lowers downtime. 

# Speed 

I have found CentOS to be very fast, certainly a lot faster than many of the big players in the Linux world like Ubuntu, Manjaro, or even Fedora. While results may vary due depending on the amount of ram you have, my CentOS instillation running with just a TUI takes up only 200mb, and my installation with a minimal Gnome desktop runs at 0.91 GB with nothing open. 

# Software Availability 

This is the part that will push a few people away from this amazing distro. The main repo offers enough to get work done. You have access to a mail client, office software, and a few browsers. However if you are a gamer or someone who likes to have a lot of extra software the regular repo’s just won’t be enough. There is a repository called EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux), and that will boost your software pool by a lot. For the things that aren’t in either repo’s, you can easily get by using FlatPak, or there are some pre-built binaries for software such as Lutris or Freetube. 

# Conclusion 

If you want the new, shiny, fancy software and are fine updating every 2 seconds, feel free to use a distro like Arch Linux or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. If you would rather have a super stable desktop that is perfect for work and super fast, I would highly recommend checking out CentOS.
