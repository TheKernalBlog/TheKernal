The debate about whether you should use Emacs or Vim is one that has been going on since before I was born, and will continue when I die. While I, and most people realize that there is no perfect answer, there are many reasons why you would like to use one over the other. Since I personally have been learning Emacs, I am going to explain some of the reasons that I use Emacs, and how these can help improve your computing experience.

# It's A Graphical Application (Mostly).

Emacs is meant to be run as a graphical application. There is a terminal mode for when you are in the tty, but 99% of the time you are going to be running a graphical Emacs client. This has a lot of advantages, like being able to customize      fonts, cursors, toolbars, and more without having to worry about what your terminal emulator is using. Plus, in the file manager and web browser, images and even video can be rendered perfectly.

# It Can Do Anything!!

While may people are under the impression that Emacs is a text editor, it is so much more. Emacs is, at its core, an an Elisp interpreter, meaning that it can run all types of applications. I personally use Emacs as my shell, web browser, file manager, calendar, task planner, and of course text editor. I rarely ever have to leave Emcas, and it is super efficient to use one set of keybindings in all of your apps. While some of these apps are limited and you may have to use something else occasionally, all of the built in apps are quite extensible and well featured.

# Buffers & Frames

Obviously, with all of these apps, it would be very annoying if every time you launched a new app, Emcas destroyed your previous app. However, Emacs solves this problem using 'Buffers' and 'Frames'. Every time that you open a new application a buffer is created; these buffers can then be killed or switched between. But, you might want to look at two different apps at the same time, and that is where frames come into play. You can think of frames as windows, specifically windows in a tiling window manager, as they don't overlap with other frames and display an Emacs application. While they take some time to learn, they are really what makes Emacs special.

# Keybindings

This is an opinion that may get me called an idiot, but I don't care. The Keybindings in Emacs are amazing. Unlike the keybindings in Vim, Emacs keybindings have purpose and make a lot of sense. This helps make them a lot easier to remember, and that is really helpful when there are hundreds of keybindings in Emacs. Plus, when typing, and your hands are flying around the keyboard already, I appreciate having keybindings in places where my hands are already resting when typing. While you can always use Evil mode, the default Emacs keybindings are truly amazing, and I would highly recommend trying them out.

# Conclusion

Emacs is amazing, and for a lot of people, it has a lot of advantages over something like Vim. It can truly help you be much more efficient when working or messing around with your computer. I cannot recommend enough just sitting down with Emacs for 2-3 hours and giving it a whirl, it may just be one of the best decisions you've made in a while.
