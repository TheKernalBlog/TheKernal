Emacs is everybodys text editor/file manager/email client/gaming platform/browser. Due to the fact that it is endlessly customizable, it only makes sense that there are a few distributions Spacemacs, Doom Emacs, and Prelude. I have tried all of these forks, and I am going to give my honest review of them all, including what purpouse they serve, how well they do at achieving that purpouse, and what it is like adapting to them.

# Doom Emacs
## Simple yet powerful
Out of all the emacs forks, Doom Emacs seems to be the most popular. In my opinion, this is because although Doom Emacs adds a lot of the functionality that other IDE's and text editors have, it doesn't overwhelm the user with too much. Someone competent with vim could easilly pick up doom emacs and get a lot out of it. It brings a filetree, vi like keybindings, and a much less complicated interface than most other forks. As someone who has used vim for a while and is currently learning emacs, I found Doom emacs really easy to use and adapt to.

# Spacemacs
## Can't believe it's not vim! 

What brings many people to Emacs is the amazing support for plugins, many people do not actually like the keybindigs for Emacs. Well, that is where Spacemacs comes in. While Doom Emacs also makes use of EVil, it really shines in Spacemacs, and there were times where I forgot that I was using emacs. It took some getting used too, I had to do some research on how to manager buffers along with other Emacs features, but after around an hour, I found it very intuitive. If you are purely using Emacs for org mode, Elisp support, or all of the pre-installed and configured apps, Spacemacs is a great option if you would rather not completely re-learn how to use your text editor.

# Prelude
## Emacs with a new look

While the other Emacs distributions have tried to play a lot with the default configuration, the main goal of Prelude is mainly improve the UX and support for different programing languages. It features many themes built in, and allows you to easilly switch between them. While there were some changes to the user interface, it wasn't a huge difference. It allows you to get a fully riced out emacs without having to do a lot of manual configuration. Plus, it includes many other tools when it comes to writing code, and a boatload of plugins too.

# Conclusion

These 3 Emacs distributions are great, and depending on what you would like to achieve, I would recommend them all. If you would like something filled to the brim with plugins, I'd go with Prelude, if you want something very close to vim, I would use Spacemacs, and if you would like an even split between the two, Doom Emacs is a great compromise. You can enjoy the glory of GNU Emacs without having to do a bunch of work to set it up how you would like. So join us, download your favorite emacs distribution, and play snake in your text editor.
