Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Vivaldi, and Brave. What do these browsers have in common? They all suck. While albeit, some suck more than others, (Cough, cough, Google Chrome) one of these stands out. Brave tries to make you see them a privacy browser that you can trust. But it turns out that is really not the case. Brave is a slow, bloated, untrustworthy browser that, while certainly better than non-free browsers, is an abomination compared to any other open sourced browser.

## Brave is slow

While Brave is often pushed as a faster, sleeker browser, it is much less efficient than Firefox or Chromium. While anyone with two eyes and any experience with Brave can attest to its longer load times and bloated interface, there is some actual proof for its inefficency. For example, this [kind Reddit user](https://teddit.net/u/Working_Dealer_5102) ran some tests, reporting around 300mb more memory and 17% more CPU usage than firefox with an identical amount of popular sites open.

## Affiliate links

Brave will do anything for a buck. This includes adding their own affiliate links into sites. While this is not the worst thing in the world, it shows a huge breach of trust. The Brave CEO has apologized and claimed that they won't do this again. However, it really showcases that Brave is so desperate that they are willing to do anything just to get some cash.

## Crypto

While most Crypto sucks, BAT sucks a lot more. It is a cryptocurrency that is given to you for watching opt-in adds. While that is not a bad idea in itself, it is enacted in a awful way. One of the main complaints is Uphold. Uphold, against the whole anethisis of Crypto, is a centralized platform, and the only place to use BAT. It has been bashed for not only being the only option available, but the interface is often a mess and hard to understand. Plus, if you do any web search, you will see hundreds of people complaining about people not getting their payout, or getting significantly less than what they're owed.

# Conclusion

Brave isn't the worst browser in the world, but there is no way in hell that it is one of the best. While it is often pushed as a privacy respecting and fast browser, it really isn't that good at either. I can't tell you what to do. But, I can urge you, please, give Firefox, Pale Moon, or BadWolf a try. You'll be happy you did.
