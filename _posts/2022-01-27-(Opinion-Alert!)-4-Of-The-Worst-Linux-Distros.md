What is the worst Linux distro? This question can never be 100% answered, because there are so many Linux users that all have their different opinions and ideas. Whether the distro is slow, has no reason to exist, or even spies on you, I am going to list  4 of the Linux distros that I have the least respect for. 

# Linspire 
## Worse CromeOS
Have you ever used Chrome OS? Many people have, and most Linux users are not a fan because of the fact that it spies on you and is dependent on Chrome. So, what if Chrome Os was slower, more buggy, and based on Ubuntu? You have Linspire. In my attempts to install it in a VM, the installer froze several times despite my quite good hardware. Even once I got it installed, and using GPU-Passthrough, it was freezing constantly and using around 2Gb and 30% CPU usage on my VM with 4GB of ram and 4 CPU cores. Plus, it is full of Google apps and applications, which harms privacy for the user. It really should never be used under any circumstance. 

# Kodachi 
## Bad privacy distro 

When you go looking for privacy focussed Linux distros, you are going to find Whonix, Qubes, and Tails. If you look deeper however, you will find a little operating system called, "Kodachi". It looks great on the surface, with TOR + VPN, a bunch of different privacy browsers, and a lot of cool configuration options. However, they do not have a good reputation. For the longest time, they told you on their webpage, " Kodachi is totally free however we have to pay monthly fees for the rent of VPN servers. Therefore in order to make Kodachi stay free we are utilizing small portion of the CPU resources less than 1% on any computer that runs Kodachi." Plus, they do not support Tor or VPN protecting for IPv6, which can and will expose your real IP address.

# Voyager OS 
## Has no reason to exist 

Almost any Linux distro made has some reason behind it, some reason that it was created. And yet, I can't find one for Voyager OS. It has no different apps, features, or optimizations than Ubuntu or Debian, literally the only difference is the default theme and the status bar on the bottom. Really, by installing a single theme you can make Voyager OS totally obsolete. There is not much more to say, because there is literally nothing to this distro. 

# Manjaro
## Arch Linux but bad 

What is the best thing about Arch Linux? Many would say that it is the up to date packages, reliability, and speed that sets it apart from other distros. Manjaro, while based on Arch Linux, is nothing like Arch. Unlike almost every other Arch based distro, it does not use the official repositories. They hold back their software one weak behind the Arch repositories. "Why" you ask, no reason. They literally don't do anything other than hold the packages back and claim that it is for stability. Also, their package manager, PaMac has been known to DDOS the Arch User Repository, slowing it down dramatically. ArchLabs, Endeavour OS, and AcroLinux all fill the need for an "easy to use Arch" much better. 

# Conclusion 

Don't take this too seriously. There are plenty of people who run these distributions every day and are more than happy with it. But if I were to try and sway people from using any distros, it would be these. They are slow, buggy, and can all be replaced by something different and better. So if you care about having an actually good operating system, I would not recommend using any of these.
