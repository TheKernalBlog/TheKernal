My last blog was about Puppy Linux. While I do not use it as a daily driver, I have a puppy USB handy and am a huge fan of Puppy Linux. While in my last blog I was talking about specifically FossaPup, Puppy Linux has a lot more “pups” to offer. I am going to go over 5 derivatives of Puppy Linux and what makes them unique. This will include official and nonofficial “pups”. So, lets get into it. 

# ArchPup

Archpup is not your traditional Pup. It does not use the puppy package manager, JWM, or the rox file manager. It is a lot like an Arch version of Debian Dog, as it uses pacman instead of the puppy package manager. However, it still has everything that is loved about puppy. It is USB persistent, runs off of the Ram, and it is very minimal. It is the perfect pup for people who want the speed and portability of Puppy, with the cutting edge packages of arch. 

# Slacko Puppy

This is the Pup of choice for a lot of people with old computers. Due to it being based on Slackware, it has great hardware detection for older computers. Any Wifi cards or old CPU’s that might not work correctly on newer pups will most likely work on Slacko Puppy. I would say that if you have a old computer that you need to revive, Slacko Puppy is a great choice. 

# MacPup

While it is not the most popular, Enlightenment is a great desktop environment that is super fast. So, there are a lot of people who are going to want to try to check it out. Luckily, MacPup is here. It is just Puppy Linux version 5 with the enlightenment desktop. While it is not as unique as many of the other puppies that I am talking about, MacPup is good for any MacOS users or people who love the Enlightenment desktop. 

# SpeakPup 

It is a shame that when open source apps and OS’s are being designed, visually impared people are often left out. However, SpeakPup was made for blind or legally blind people. It comes with a speech server, braill support, and a screen reader. It is based on a older version of puppy, but it still comes with everything that you would need to browse the web and do some work. It is the perfect distro for someone who is blind, fully or legally. 

# MijinPup 

If the think that is holding you back from using puppy is it’s weird selection of apps, then MijinPup may just be the thing for you. Instead of coming with the pale moon browser and AbiWord, it comes with the more standard Firefox and Libreoffice. Without compromising speed, it is able to fit in a lot of apps that you would use on a daily basis. Making it great for anyone who needs all of the applications that they are used to from using other Linux distros. 

# Conclusion

These are 5 of the best “pups” that you can get for Puppy Linux. Whether it is a different desktop, different apps, or utilities that you may need, these are all great choices for a desktop that are only made better due to them being based off of Puppy Linux.
