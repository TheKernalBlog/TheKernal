If you are an experienced Linux user, there is a good chance that you are using a tiling window manager. They are a great choice for anyone that needs something minimal, fast, and customizable. Plus, Tiling window managers have a lot of variety to them. Whether they are written in different languages, tile differently, or even have different features, there are many tiling window managers that serve different purposes. However, this means that there are many tiling window managers that many people don't know about, and to fix that, I am going to show you 5 of my favorite, less common tiling window manager. And hey, you might find one that you really like.

# Enlightenment
## Tiling Desktop Environment.

Some people will give me some slack for this, but yes, Enlightenment it a tiling window manager. On the first time booting into Enlightenment, you can choose to use tiling windows. You can use all of the tiling window manager features that you are used to while having all of the features that you would find in any other full desktop like KDE or XFCE. It uses the amazing EFL toolkit, and, from my experience, runs better than any other fully featured desktop environment on older hardware. It is something I would heavily consider if you are looking to have tiling windows without having to build your own desktop environment from scratch.

# HerbsluftWM
## Unique Tiling Features.
HerbsluftWM, like i3 is a manual tiling window manager. But, it has some cool features that other tiling window managers doesn't have. You can configure without having to restart the window manager, you can split monitors into smaller sub-monitors, and you can even switch the contents of two monitors on the fly. Plus, the tiling algorithm is super unique, by using frames that can further be split into more frames. It is overall just a very unique tiling window manager that excels at multi-monitor use.

# EXWM
## Emacs Is A Window Manager??!!!
There is an old joke in the Linux community, that once you use Emacs, you aren't a Linux user anymore, you are an Emacs user. I can vouch for that, as I have recently started replacing all of my apps with Emacs. Well, you can now use Emacs as your window manager. It is a window manager that is written in Elisp and acts like Emacs. Plus, it has the cool feature where you can use Emacs keybindings in other Xorg apps. This is actually the tiling window manager that I am currently using. 

# Sway
## Xorg Is Dead!!!

While big desktop environments like GNOME and KDE have already adopted Wayland, tiling window managers are very apprehensive. However, Sway is up to the challenge. Sway is a lot like i3, and is even compatible with i3 configuration files. The only real difference is that it uses the Wayland protocol instead of the ancient Xorg. Wayland is more modern, faster, and minimal that Xorg, and will eventually make it obsolete. However, if you are planning to use Sway, you are going to have to do some extra configuration because some apps (I'm looking at you Firefox) don't work great out of the box. But, it is still an amazing tiling window manager that is ahead of the game.

# Notion
## Do It Yourself.

Notion is a forked version of the now dead "Ion" window manager. Notion differentiates itself from others by not only making use of "Tabbing", but also being a static window manager. Unlike other tiling window managers, you can smush two windows in the same pane and make use of tabbing to switch between them. Plus, because it is static, you get to choose where each individual window is placed, it doesn't just choose for you. The workflow is super unique, and feels like something that you can't just replicate.

# Conclusion

One of the greatest things about tiling window managers is just how many of them there are, and, like these 5, they are all built around a specific and unique workflow. So, while these are not the most common tiling window managers, I would highly recommend trying them out and seeing if you would like to give one of them a chance. If anything else, it gives you the chance to show your superiority over other "generic" tiling window manager users.
