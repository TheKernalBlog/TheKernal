NuTyX, chances are that you haven’t used this name before if you don’t live in Europe. NuTyX is a French Linux distribution that I have had the joy of trying out. I am going to go over my experience with this great Linux distro, and why you would want to check it out. 

# Independence 

Unlike most other Linux distro’s, NuTyX is not based on anything at all. It used Linux From Scratch to create their own distro. It isn’t Debian based, it isn’t Arch based, and it isn’t even RHEL based, it’s just Based. This means that it is able to go in it’s own direction instead of having to worry about the upstream. 

# Package management 

NuTyX uses it’s own package manager called ‘Cards’, and I was surprised at﻿ the amount of software that was available. One thing I really liked is that they also have ports. If you have used FreeBSD, you should know how ports work. It is a directory that contains all of the necessary files to install a package. There is a Pkgfile script that allows you to make a package that can then be installed using the cards package manager. 

# Branches 

There are three versions of NuTyX, the regular version that it very stable, the testing version that it updated regularly, and the rolling branch that is constantly updated as soon as the newest software comes out. In this manner, you could think of it like Debian. 

# Desktops 

NuTyX comes with all of the popular Linux deskops like MATE, LXDE, GNOME, KDE, and XFCE. So there is no need to worry that you will not be able to use your favorite desktop environment.  NuTyX is also a DE hopper’s dream, as they provide a very easy script that will completely remove your desktop and install a different desktop of your choice, making it one of the most flexible Linux distro’s I have used in a while. 

# Systemd 

I believe that NuTyX takes a great approach to Systemd. Unlike other Linux distro’s that have taken sides to be either for or against Systemd, NuTyX  allows the user to decide between the old-school SysVinit, Systemd, or the homebrewed runyx innit system. 

# Instillation 

The Install process for NuTyX is easy and unique. They provide regular iso’s that can be used to install like any other Linux distro, but it also provides a Gentoo-like install process where you can install it from another Linux distro, or a live USB.  They provide a super easy to use script called ‘install-nutyx’ that I tried out in a Virtual Machine, and it worked out great. 

# Conclusion 

NuTyX isn’t just another dime a dozen Debian clone like a lot of other Linux distro’s right now. It is something special. It’s fast, independent, easy to install, and very unique. If you are looking for a new distro, I would give NuTyX some serious consideration, because it is great.
