I have covered the Lumina desktop environment, so it is only fair that I cover Trinity. Trinity is a desktop environment that was based off of KDE3. Think of it like Mate and Gnome2. Trinity is meant to be a continuation of the K desktop environment version 3. After using it in a VM, I am going to try to explain the positives of this desktop, and discuss if you should use it or not. 


## Speed

Speed is one of the major factors of this desktop. I was running it on Q4OS. Due to me running Qubes, I had to run the VM inside of a VM to get the desktop. It was very responsive, considering that it had no GPU and only 2 cores. I would say that is is comparable in speed to XFCE. It is still slower than LXDE/LXQT or a Window manager, but I would still recommend it to anyone with older hardware that may have trouble running KDE5 or Gnome. It also doesn’t need systemd, meaning that it can run super fast on Devaun or Artix. 

## Appearance 

The default our of the box look and feel of Trinity is a lot like Windows 7. It is however, very customizable. You can switch icons, GTK themes, Panel items and positions, and whatever else you can do on most desktop environments. While it doesn’t have the large list of check-boxes that KDE5 has, it is still plenty customizable. It is great for anyone who likes tinkering with their system. 

## Applications 

KDE3 had a large ecosystem. That is why it was such a shame when they upgraded and left it all behind. However, Trinty tries to preserve that ecosystem. Trinity has a lot of apps, all of wich are optional. Unlike some of the KDE5 apps, they are also extremely fast. You can see a list of all of the apps on https://www.trinitydesktop.org/applications.php . 

# Should You Use Trinity? 

If you have used and enjoyed KDE3 in the past, Trinity may just be the right desktop for you. It comes with a whole boatload of apps, and is very lightweight. So if you are a fan of fast, feature fact Desktops I would recommend that you try it out. It is a really great desktop with tons of work put in.
