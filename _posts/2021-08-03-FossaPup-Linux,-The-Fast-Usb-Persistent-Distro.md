Puppy Linux, a lot of people know about this small Linux distro. However, there are not a bunch of people who are using puppy as a daily driver. Personally, I have a puppy Linux on a USB just in case my hard drive fails. However, I have tried to play around with it so that I can get a feel for this unusual Linux distro. So, I am going to go over all of the things that make this Linux distro special. 

# Installation 

One of the great things about Puppy Linux is that you do not actually have to install it. You can plug in a puppy Linux USB, make all your changes and make all of your files and then change it all on your USB. This is great if you have multiple computers that you want to sync all of your files with. You can install it on your hard drive. The process of installing it on your hard drive is not very hard at all. However, you have to partition all of the partitions yourself. As long as you can partition, you can install it very easily. 

# Desktop and Apps 

Depending on what Pup you choose, you will have a different desktop environment. However, I only used the newest Ubuntu based pup. Fossapup comes with the J Window Manager. This helps it be lightweight. However, even on FossaPup you can install the regular Desktop Environments like XFCE and Mate. The applications that come with puppy are not familiar to a lot of people, but they are really easy to get used to. For example, it comes with the Pale Moon browser, Geany text editor, and the URXVT terminal. However, after about a day of usage, they are super easy to use. 

# Speed 

Puppy was made to run off of your Ram. Way back in the day when hard drives were super slow, Puppy was the solution. Puppy runs entirely in your Ram so that you can run it on computers that have a bad hard drive, or no hard drive at all. This means that it is a great option for anyone who has a old and slow computer that they would like to bring back from the dead. 

# Security Issues 

You can’t talk about Puppy without bringing up it’s security issues.  It was designed to run everything using root. This can be a big problem because anyone that has aces to your computer can completely just screw everything up. The puppy linux team has tried to make this less of a issue by adding “Spot”. Spot is a restricted user. You can run whatever apps you want as Spot so that you are not giving any would be hackers access to your root account. This is not ideal, but it gives you some security. 

# The Puppy Package Manager 

Puppy Linux has it’s own graphical package manager. Funny enough, it has a very large amount of applications and is super easy to use. The only problem is that there is no update button in the Package Manager itself. You can either find the newer versions of software yourself, or go into Menu > Setup > Quickpet Fossa > Updates. I only ever used FossaPup, so I am not 100% sure if there is anything like it in the other “pups”. 

# Conclusion 

Puppy Linux is a great Linux distro made to do one thing. Be portable and fast on old computers. I would not recommend it for daily use on a hard drive. If you want to use it as a daily driver, knock yourself out. Being able to just unplug your pen drive and plug it into another computer and have your OS and files ready for use is a powerful tool. I would recommend that you flash it on a USB and give it a spin.
