When it comes to mobile smart phones, Google and Apple have a duopoly. Much like Apple and Microsoft did/still do. There are some projects that are changing this. Making open sourced phones that allow use Linux in your pocket. I am going to go over three of the most popular, and best phones that use Linux. So that you can incorporate free and open sourced software into every facet of your life. 

# PinePhone 

When most people think of “Linux Phone” they often think of a Pinephone. There is a good reason why too. It is a very easy to use, and steal of a deal compared to other Linux phones. It starts at around 150$ US dollars, witch is cheaper than a lot of regular Android/IPhones. By default, it comes with Manjaro ARM. Meaning that you get a fast, Linux distro that allows you to take advantage of the newest versions of a lot of software. However, they do allow you to use PostMarketOS, UbPorts, SailfishOS, and much more. If you are looking for a budget phone that allows you to take advantage of a lot of software, this is the phone for you. 

# Volla Phone

This is the only phone on this list that has a option for Android with the Android based Volla OS. You can order it with Ubuntu touch. There is even a community made version of Sailfish OS that was made for this phone. It has very good specs, with a 6.3 inch display, 4GB of ram, and 64GB of storage. All for 420$ Us dollars. If you would like a phone that can handle a heavy workload with all of your desktop apps, while still being affordable, the Volla phone is for you. 

# Librem 5

There are a lot of people, me included, that got into Linux because of the privacy features. If you are a big privacy fan, this may just be the phone for you. It is a bit pricey compared to the PinePhone, coming in at 899$ US dollars. It has physical kill switches for the Camera and Microphone. Even better, it comes with the fully free Linux distro PureOS. One of the few Linux distros that is officially supported by the Free Software Foundation. I would say that this is possibly the most private phone ever. If you really would like a phone that cares about your privacy, and price isn’t as much of a factor, I would 100% recommend this for you. 

# Conclusion 

If you would like to use Linux desktop apps, and take abvantge of the speed that Linux provides, these are all great phones. Whether it is for privacy fanatics, people who want a cheap phone, or for people who want a lot of performance fromt heir phone, these are all good options that allow you to use Linux without ever having to use a laptop/desktop.
