Solus. It is the Linux distro that I am currently using. It is a completely independent, rolling release, and has a custom desktop environment with a fast package manager. I am going to go over the pro’s, and the cons of using this very “different” Linux distro. 

The budgie desktop environment is the thing that brings many people into Solus. It was made for Solus. Just like cosmic, it was made to compensate for the shortcomings of the gnome desktop environment. It is slightly lighter than Gnome, but not by much. Having the panel on the right that allows you to control music, sound, a calendar, and your notifications is very good for productivity. While it is not m favorite, budgie is a great desktop environment that I would recommend for almost anyone, at the cost of being slow. 

The package manager is the best thing about this distro. After some research, I found that it was forked from Pardus Linux. It is fast, really fast. I would say that it is on par with pacman. With its own software center, it is also accessible for beginners. It allows you to get a lot of the basic programs that you would need for work, or gaming. However, due to it being independent there is not very many packages. So even though it is rolling release, updates will not take that long. 

For most people, I would say that Solus is a good choice for a Linux distro. It is good for someone who wants something like arch, that doesn’t break all the time or take 10 hours to update. However, it lacks a lot of packages, and while you can get different desktop environments, the default is a bit too slow for my liking.
