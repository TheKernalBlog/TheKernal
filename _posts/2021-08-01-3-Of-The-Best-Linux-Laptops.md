When you get a laptop as a Linux user, the first step is going to be to flash it with your Linux distro of choice. However, there are laptops that come pre-instlaled with Linux. These can range from budget laptops that are only made cheaper by not requiring Windows, to powerhouses that are made for software engineers and gamers. So, I am going to go over three of the best Linux laptops. 

# System76 Serval WS
### The Beast

The System76 Serval WS is a beast. It outperforms a lot of regular desktop gaming computers. It comes with 12 CPU cores, 24 CPU threads, an RTX 2070, and 64 GB of Ram. You can downgrade it, however it is still expensive. The starting price is around 1,300, with the lowest specs. However, that is still a fairly good price when compared to desktops with the same performance. It, being a System76 laptop, runs Pop! OS. Pop! OS is optimized for gaming and goes great with such a powerful system. Overall, if you want a computer that can do some heavy lifting and are willing to pay the price, the System76 Serval WS might just be the laptop for you. 

# Pursim Librem 13 laptop 
### The Privacy Laptop

The Pursim Librem 13 is the perfect laptop for privacy fanatics like me. It is not the fastest in the world, with an Intel Core i7 CPU, up to 32GB of Ram, and an Intel HD Graphics 620 GPU. It is enough to get a lot of work done, but it is not for gamers. It comes with PureOS as itâ€™s operating system, meaning that all of the software and drivers will be completely free. To add to its privacy, it has physical kill switches for the camera and microphone. It starts around 1,499. It is a lot like if you took all the good things about a macbook, and added a focus on privacy. 

# Clevo NL41LU
### Linux Laptop on a budget 	

If you are looking for a Linux laptop as an alternative to something like a chromebook, this may just be the laptop for you. The starting price of just 500$, it can be very appealing for anyone who needs something cheap for light work. It has the choice of an Intel i5, i3, or i7 CPU, up to 32GB of memory, and an Intel UHD graphics card. It comes with the choice of over 12 Linux distros, meaning that you will most likely be able to use your preferred Linux distro. 

# Conclusion 

These are not the three only options for a Linux laptop, but they are some of the best at doing your preferred workload or tasks. Ranging in price, Linux distro choice, and hardware.
