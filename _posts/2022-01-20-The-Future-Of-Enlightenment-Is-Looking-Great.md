When many people think of Linux desktop environments, they think of GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and maybe a window manager like i3. However, there is another huge desktop environment that many people don't know about. Enlightenment is a desktop environment that not only is super lightweight, but looks amazing with a lot of customization options and an iconic style. Enlightenment has had a great year, and I am going to go over the new exciting projects revolving around Enlightenment and the EFL toolkit.

# Budgie 

There are a lot of people who do not like LibAdiwata and GTK4, as it limits the options for customizing Linux apps and desktops. And the Solus team, who would rather not write apps for QT, they chose EFL from the Enlightenment desktop. With the popularity of Ubuntu Budgie and the dedicated fans of Solus, this will bring a lot more devs to the Enlightenment team. 

# Enlightenment 0.25.0 

Just recently. Enlightenment released it's new version, 0.25.0. I have to say, this was a much needed improvement for the average user. The default theming for the desktop has gotten a much more flat look, and everything looks much more cohesive. I also found that the resource usage was actually much better than the previous version, with no stuttering or freezing in my virtual machine.

# Samsung

If you ever wondered what Samsung was running on their smart TV's, it is Enlightenment. Because of how lightweight and beautiful Enlightenment is, having it on your brand of TV's makes a lot of sense. And with how prevalent Samsung is in the growing smart TV, it is probably going to be Enlightenment's best bet when it comes to funding.

# Conclusion 

I truly believe that by the end of 2022, Enlightenment will be the best, most improved desktop in the Linux sphere. With all of the new eyes on EFL and Enlightenment from Budgie, the corporate backing from Samsung, and even the new improved user interface, I am looking forward to the future of this amazing desktop environment.
