Nowadays, many Linux distros, especially Arch based distro's are all the same. They slap a new logo and desktop on there, and say it's a brand new Linux distro like something that you've never seen before. For the longest time, that's how I've seen Reborn OS. Arch with an installer. But now, after giving it a fair shot, It turns out it has quite a few nifty tools and tricks that I think really differentiate it from the others. I am going to give a brief explanation of some features that I think are worth mentioning, and maybe see if I can convince you to give Reborn OS a try. 

## Desktop Options 

One thing that stands out almost immediately, is the amount of desktop environments available. While Reborn OS includes all of the staples, GNOME, KDE, XFCE, Mate, and LXQT, it also includes some less common desktops, such as Deepin, Cutefish, Regolith, UKUI, Cinnamon, and even the now defunct LXDE. As far as I know, the only desktop that they don't have available is Trinity. Although, that is understandable. 

## Resource Efficiency 

Being based on vanilla Arch, Reborn OS is much faster than any other Arch-based distro that I've used. With no Xorg running, my virtual machine with 4GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores was idling at around 90-95MB of RAM used, and only occasional memory spikes peaking at around 1-3% CPU usage of a single core. All being said, it's a pretty damn good result. 

## Reborn OS Fire 

One of the best things to come out of the Reborn OS project is Reborn OS Fire. Reborn OS Fire is sort of like YaST, except it's a lot easier to use, and has less functionality. Reborn OS Fire allows you to uninstall and install both desktop environments and display managers automatically. It even automates the install and setup process of using an alternative kernel like Linux Zen, LTS, or the Hardened Linux kernel. 

## Cnchi Installer 

Reborn OS, instead of using the default Calamaris installer that everyone else is using, decided to build their own. Cnchi is a delightful, easy to use, and extremely well featured installer. Not only does it allow you to choose your kernel, proxy's, mirrors, and even whether you would like to use the AUR or not. Then, before you set up your user account and install, there is a "feature selection" tool, where you can install your web browser, office suite, drivers, media player, and much more. The installer is perfect, giving you every option available, while still staying simple and easy to use. 

## Reborn OS Pace

Pace is the final Reborn OS app that I'll talk about tody. And it is something desperately missing from most Linux distros. It is a graphical utility in which you can use to configure your repositories. Pace allows you to enable and disable them with nothing but a simple tap of a button. It also shows a comprehensive list of all mirrors available, allowing you to choose those instead. 

# Conclusion 

While Reborn OS isn't comparable to something like Qubes OS or Fedora Silverblue when it comes to innovation, it isn't another souless fork either. Reborn OS is a nice little distro that has been working on making a configurable and easy to use system. They did a little more than just slap a logo and calamaris installer on there (cough, cough, Endeavor OS).
