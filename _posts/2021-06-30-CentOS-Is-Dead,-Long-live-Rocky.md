While you can still use it right now, CentOS is basically dead. CentOS is no longer going to be the downstream from RHEL. The current version on CentOS will reach end of life at the end of 2021. RHEL is now the most stable out of Fedora, RHEL, or CentOS. However, there is still hope. Rocky Linux. 

Rocky Linux is a open source Operating System that is meant to take the place of CentOS. It will be the downstream from RHEL. So whenever RHEL gets a update, it will get one as well. This means that it will be just as stable as CentOS once was. Rocky Linux is made by the co-founder of CentOS. It aims to be completely free while being super stable. 

Rocky Linux comes with the Gnome3 desktop environment. They have a minimalist version made for servers, a CD version made for desktop use, and a boot version for a net install. It comes with old drivers and open sourced drivers, so there is a chance that your WiFi/GPU might not work. However this improves stability and privacy.

If you are a fan of CentOS, I would highly recommend that you decide to try out Rocky Linux. While CentOS may have died, it will continue to live on in Rocky Linux. Being stable, and completely free means that Rocky Linux could very well be the operating system for you.
