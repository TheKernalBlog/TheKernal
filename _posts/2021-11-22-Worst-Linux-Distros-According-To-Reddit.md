On november 18th, 2021 a post was made to Reddit on a Linux subreddit. The post read, “You get to remove one distro from the face of the earth, as if it had never been created. All distro’s based on it will also be removed. What do you choose to get rid of?”. This post was made by me. I am going to go over the most common answers, and what reasons were given. 

# Ubuntu 

Ubuntu was the distro that people would choose to get rid of the most. A lot of the reasons were that people didn’t like the direction Canonical was going. Another reason that people gave was that if it weren’t for Ubuntu, all of the good distro’s would base themselves on Debian. Overall, the hate for Ubuntu is very strong in the Linux community. 

# Arch

This is the one that supprised me the most. With only one less vote than Ubuntu, people were hating Arch. The main reason was that it is unstable. However, most of the responses that mentioned Arch Linux didn’t provide a reason. 

# Manjaro 

In the same vain as Arch, Manjaro came in 3rd. The reasons provided were that it  is less stable than Arch, and bloated. One commenter, u/BillTran163 provided one of the best reasons i’ve seen. They claimed, “The distro is literally the definition of "be lazy now and pay for it later"”. I for one am suprised that it is below Arch, but it maked sense because Arch is more popular.  

# Tie - ChromeOS 

It is very easy to see why ChromeOS would be one of the least liked Linux distro’s. Most Linux users do not like proprietary software, and Chrome OS is built almost entirely on the closed-source browser Chrome, which is known for spying on you. However, there were some counter-arguments that ChromeOS has been an overall benifit for Linux by making it more popular. 

# Tie - Gentoo

Gentoo got the exact amount of votes as ChromeOS, which sort of makes sense because Chrome OS is based on Gentoo. One of the main reasons is that the package manager, “portage” is writen in python. It also takes hours to compile software which a lot of people can agree is very annoying. 

# Conclusion 

I would like for you to remember that this is not super accurate of most people’s interpretation of what Linux distro’s are the worst. Even the idea of the ‘worst’ Linux distro is completely subjective, but the answers that I collected are good examples of what people think about Linux distros and their reasons for disliking them.
