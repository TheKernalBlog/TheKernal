When you think of Android, what do you think? A Phone from your favorite manufacturer, Google, or maybe even smart tv's and tablets. What many people don't think about is desktop Linux, but it turns out that with Bliss OS, desktop Android is a great choice for everyone. I tried out the FOSS version of Bliss OS, and I am going to go over some of the great things about Bliss OS, and why you should consider using it.

# FOSS Applications 

While Bliss OS has a default version with all of the regular stock Android apps, they are one of the few desktop Android ROMs that offer a FOSS version. While being based on the Linux kernel, Android itself is already Free and Open Sourced. This version takes away all of the Google apps and replaces them with FOSS alternatives, including FDroid, Newpipe, and FOSS versions of a file manager, camera, and other apps. All apps that I personally use on my actual phone and they all work fantastically. 

# Install 

I felt like the install was not super welcoming for newer users, but it is still very easy. I would compare it to the Void Linux installer, in that it is graphical, very fast, but however forces you to do some partitioning and use a tui interface. Granted, if you have the smallest amount of information on partitioning and know how to look something up on the internet, you really should be fine. 

# Resource Usage 

The resource usage of Bliss OS was not bad at all, with around 500-600 mb of ram and usually less than 5% of the CPU being used on a cold boot in a virtual machine that had 2GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores available. Bliss OS is really not a bad option if you would like to revive an old unused laptop from the dead and make it useful. 

# Desktop 

Obviously, unlike many other desktop Linux distros, you aren't going to have a standard desktop environment like XFCE, GNOME, or KDE. Bliss OS has two launchers available, the open sourced lawnchair launcher that works great on laptops with touchscreen or tablets, and they also have a launcher designed for the desktop, that brings a traditional desktop experience with a panel on the bottom and floating windows. My only complaint would be that pressing the super key doesn't bring up the menu. 

# Hardware Support 
 
While you might think that something only really designed to run on phones would be a pain to get working on a desktop, Bliss OS works on almost everything. Since it does in fact run the Linux kernel, all of the drivers that are built into the kernel will work on Bliss OS. The only kind of hardware related issue I had was trying to get it to work on my two monitor setup.  

# Conclusion 

Whether you would like to run Android apps on your desktop in a VM, or you would like to repurpose an old computer or laptop into something useful, Bliss OS is the best option currently. It is much easier and simpler to set up than pure Android x86, and doesn't force you to de-google Android. You can have the functionality of Android on your computer, with the added benefit of being able to confuse your friends when you run Android apps on your desktop.
