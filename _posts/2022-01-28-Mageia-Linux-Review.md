If you ask a old-school Linux user what Linux distro they first used, most likely you will get the response of Debian, Slackware, or Mandrake. Nowadays, while Debian and Slackware are both alive and kicking, Mandrake died. It has no more development, and it was up to the community to create a replacement. The Mandrake replacement that is currently the most popular is Mageia, a Linux distro based on the old Mandrake and run by a non-profit. So, I decided to fire up KVM and try it out, and I am going to give my honest reviews when it comes to the software, desktop, hardware support, and the Mageia control center.  

# Software 

Mageia uses the rpm package format, with their own repositories and the ability to use the dnf package manager, along with their own graphical package manager built into the control center. It also was quite stable, with some old packages, but not too outdated to where is is impractical to use on the desktop. It also seems that they have even made some tweaks to dnf so that it is not as slow is it might be on Fedora or CentOS. 

# Desktop 

Mageia currently has a GNOME, KDE, and XFCE desktop edition available. They are all slightly tweaked with some branding, and the XFCE addition seems to have taken up a Mate-like two panel user interface. KDE and GNOME were basically stock, with very few changes, which is very refreshing with everybody nowadays trying to destroy their desktops with a bunch of unneeded configurations.   

# Hardware support 

Along with Pop_OS!, I would say that Mageia has some of the best hardware support. All of their iso's come with the Nvidea drivers pre-installed, and the Mageia control center comes with tools for installing and configuring any driver that you would ever need. I dare anyone to find a peice of hardware that Mageia couldn't run on. It is just that good when it comes to hardware support.   


# Mageia control center 

OpenSUSE often gets praised for its YaST control center. Apart from Red Hat's Cockpit, there is nothing like it out     right now. That is, except for the Magia control center. Much like YaST, the Mageia control center center can handle     hardware configuration, package management, boot configuration, disk partitioning, and so much more. It is one of t    he easiest and most effective configuration tools I've ever used.

# Conclusion    

Mageia feels like not only a blast to the past, but a look into the future. Mageia's governance is super progressive, it is super fast, and super stable. It has found a great formula, and as long as they keep to their formula, they are going to do great. I look forward to the develoupment of Mageia and I would reccomend that you check it out.
