When choosing a arch based distro, there are a few options. Two of the most popular are Manjaro, and Endeavour OS. These two both have strengths, and weaknesses that I hope to lay out. By the end, you should have a better understanding of what distro would be the best for you. 

Manjaro: 

Manjaro is the most popular of the two arch based distros. However it doesn’t actually use the arch repositories. They use their own repositories when installing software. These are almost always around a week behind. This allows them to make sure that the software doesn’t have any big, system breaking bugs. It doesn’t have the AUR enabled by default, but it can be enabled. The software center allows you to install, and update anything without even needing to touch the terminal. The software center also has the option for snaps and flatpacks, wich means that you are going to get almost any piece of software that you ever need. I would recommend Manjaro for any new Linux user, that would like to have the newest software, without needing to do anything complicated. 

Endeavour OS: 

Endeavour OS feels a lot more like arch. It ships with only the software that is absolutely nececary, and the software provided by your desktop environment. There is no software center, so if you want to install anything you will have to use pacman or yay. Unlike Manjaro, it uses the same repositories as Arch, so you will get the newest software right when it is put on Arch. Overall, Endeavour OS is a much more Arch like experience. It was made for Linux novices who didn’t want the hastle of installing Arch. 

Overall, I would say that if you are a beginer that wants a full desktop experience right out of the box, Manjaro is for you. However, if you would like a more traditional, advanced experience with the newest software, Endeavour OS is the best distro for you.
