It is no surprise that ChromeOS is so popular. The fact that it runs mainly on web apps and Android Applications makes it very good for anyone who needs a computer for school or work. The problem however, is that it is not open sourced, and can only function with the Chrome browser, which is full of google spyware. I am going to go over three Open sourced Linux OS’s that you can use as an alternative to ChromeOS. 

# Peppermint OS 
## For Web App fans 

Peppermint OS uses the “ICE” web application management tool to seamlessly integrate web apps, making them on par with normal applications. It is suprisingly lightweight, only requiring a x86 processor and 1 GB of ram to run well. It is based on Ubuntu LTS, meaning that you can still install and use all of the applications that you would get on Ubuntu. The desktop is a weird mix of LXDE and XFCE. Overall, If you mainly work with applications that run in a web browser like Email and Microsoft Office, Peppermint OS is a good choice for you. 

# Android x86 (Lineage OS) 
## Android on the desktop. 

One of the things that ChromeOS gets a lot of praise for is being able to run Android apps. However, the best thing to run Android apps is obviously Android. Thanks to the Android x86 protect, you can use Android on your laptop or computer. They even have a x86 for the open sourced Android OS called Lineage OS. It comes rooted, and completely de-googled. You have aces to a large amount of apps using the open sourced app store “F-Droid”. If you don’t really care about running web apps, Android x86 Lineage OS is a great choice for you. 

# Ubuntu Web Remix 
## Best Overall 

Ubuntu Web Remix is the OS on this list that is most like ChromeOS. It allows you to use both Android apps and Web apps. It uses an Android emulator to run Android apps. The emulator uses the open sourced version of Android called /e/. It runs surprisingly well for an Emulator. Ubuntu Web Remix even has it’s own store where you can add web apps. My only gripe is, you can’t add web apps yourself, you have to use the ones from the store. The desktop even looks like ChromeOS, using a heavily tweaked Gnome to emulate it's look. 

# Conclusion 

Overall, I think is safe to say that ChromeOS is not your only option for running android apps and web apps on the desktop. While all three of these OS’s have their own use cases, I would recommend any one of them to someone who wants all of the utility of ChromeOS without all of the proprietary mess.
