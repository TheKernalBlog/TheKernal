When using Linux, there are a lot of applications that are going to run in your terminal. However, there are a lot of Terminal applications that are overshadowed by their GUI counterparts. So toady, I am going to go over 3 applications that can run entirely in the Linux terminal, so that you don’t have to worry about any GUI bloat. 

## Web Browser

Lynx is, in my opinion, the best terminal web browser for Linux. It is very fast, due to the fact that it does not use Javascript. It also allows you to accept or decline cookies from websites. It runs in the terminal even if you have no window manager. Due to the fact that it is in the terminal, everything can be done without the mouse. It is fast, easy to use, and can run in the terminal. What more could you want? 

## Text Editor 

Out of the three applications, Vim is by far the most popular. Vim is a text editor made to be used inside the terminal, and it is loved by developers. It was designed with keyboard shortcuts in mind, so that you will never even have to touch the mouse. It has 3 different modes, input, command. And last line. It is very complicated, but can be one of the most powerful tools for any developer. 

## File Manager

While when thinking about manipulating files in the terminal, you mostly thing about the commands that come built in with Linux, Ranger is a fully functioning file manager that runs right in your terminal. It was built with keybindings that are reminiscent of Vim. It has a directory tree that makes it very easy to move around your directories. It is a good alternative to something like Thunar if you prefer to move around and open files using the keyboard. 

# Conclusion

Overall, there are all solid options that I would consider using. Due to the fact that they run in the terminal, they are all really fast and don’t even need to have  a window manager. If you are thinking of ditching traditional GUI toold for something that runs in the terminal, these are all good choices.
