When you think of mobile Linux, most people would think of Android, followed by something like a PinePhone or Librem5. But, there is
another mobile Linux distro that is often neglected. KaiOS is a fork of the old Firefox OS, and it is one of the only non-Android Linux distros
that actually has commercial steam. I myself have recently switched to a KaiOS flip phone, and I am going give my honest review of this
unusual operating system.

## Speed & Battery Life

Obviously, one of the main draws of a flip phone is that it has great battery life. While some other flip phones may feel sluggish, I have yet to
see any stuttering or performance issues. Plus, the battery lasts a very long time. This thing can easily go 30+ hours without a charging, which
is not something that you see on most other phones nowadays.

## Apps

I found all of the pre-installed apps very nice. It comes with many of the utilities that you will use day to day, like a calculator, calendar,
music & video viewer, email client, and unit converter. I found the app store quite populated too, with most of the apps that anybody would ever
need. My only real issue is that KaiOS comes pre-installed with some google apps, but if you look hard enough you can find ways to remove them.

## Extra features

KaiOS has many features that other phones neglect. One of the best reasons why KaiOS is preferred for flip phones is that they have predictive
typing, so when texting you don't manually have to do the standard flip phone typing. You can just hit the button once and it will guess what you
are trying to say. Another cool feature is that if you plug in headphones, you have access to FM radio, which in my opinion makes up for no
Newpipe or Spotify.
## Look & Feel

The look & feel of the KaiOS interface is very efficient. With no touchscreen, they have had to try extra hard to make all of the apps and
features just a press of a button away. You have a app panel on the left side with your choice of apps, and your SMS, Contacts, Notifications,
Camera, and quick settings all have sortcuts so that you can access them easily.

# Conclusion

KaiOS is the best mobile operating system that I have ever used. It makes my flip phone just as good, if not better than a smartphone. Plus, you
don't have to deal with all of the crap google is shoving into Android nowadays. If you would like to switch to a flip phone the right way, I
would highly recommend looking for one that runs KaiOS, you won't regret it.
