For the past year I have been distrohopping like crazy. I can probably name 10 different Linux distros that I have tried out. The one that has had me using it for the longest time though, is Qubes OS. It is a distro that makes you secure by running everything inside of its own virtual machine. Network, Firewall, Desktop, all of these things are running in their own virtual machines. I am going to give a honest review, going over the good and the bad parts of using Qubes OS as your primary operating system, and maybe you would like to try it out yourself. 


# The Good


## Security 

Security is the thing that this operating system was made for. It has different virtual machines for everything. So work, school, personal, and TOR activity can all stay separate. This means that even if one of the VM’s gets compromised, all of the other ones will stay completely unaffected, This is great for Journalists, Whistleblowers, and people who don’t want all of their data stolen. 

## Using many different operating systems 

Due to how Qubes is designed, you can make a Virtual machine for almost any distro. For example, I waned the newest software for my work VM. I simply downloaded the template for arch, and I was able to use it for my work. You can do this with almost any distro, meaning that you can get the benefits of every Linux distro, without having to wipe your system every time or dual boot. 


# The Bad

## System performance 

You need a beefy computer for Qubes. The minimum that is recommended is 6Gb and a 4-core CPU. However, 16Gb of ram and an 8-core CPU is recommended. To keep everything completely separated, Qubes doesn’t use the GPU. Meaning that gaming on it is nearly impossible for any recent games to work. So if you only have a bad laptop, or you are a heavy gamer, I would not recommend that you use Qubes. 

## Complexity 

Qubes is unlike any other operating system. I think that saying Qubes is Linux on “hard mode” is 100% accurate. With template VM’s, system VM’s and Domain VM’s, it can be a bit confusing. There are many times where you have to spend hours to learn how to do something that can be done easily on a regular OS. Meaning that it takes away from time that could be spent on work. 


# Conclusion 

Overall, I love Qubes, but I don’t think that it is for everyone. I would recommend Qubes to any non gamer who wants to have the benefits of a bunch of different OS’s and a little more security. If you are a gamer, or someone who wants something that “just works” Qubes is not for you. Qubes gives you extra security, the ability to use any OS, while making your system slower and less convenient.
