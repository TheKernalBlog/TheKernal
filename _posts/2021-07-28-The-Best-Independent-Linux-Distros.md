Most Linux distros these days are based on just three Linux distros. Debian, RHEL, or Arch. Meaning, that a lot of Linux distros are going to be mainly the same besides the desktop and what packages that they get. However, there are still some completely independent Linux distros that have their own package managers and code. I am going to go over 5 of my favorites, and providing a brief explanation as to what makes them unique. 

# Gentoo 

Out of this list, Gentoo is currently the most popular. It does not use systemd, is extremely minimal, and instead of a traditional package manager it uses Portage to build everything from scratch. It is a lot like arch, in that it comes with no GUI and is not easy at all to install. The fact that you have to build everything from source makes it super reliable and easy to install software, even though it might take a long time. 

# NixOS

Nix OS was build on the Nix package manager. It makes sure that everything is built off of the nix package manager so that it stays separate from everything else. This means that if you update one package and it breaks, the other ones will be completely fine. It also allows you to roll back to previous versions of packages If they break, or you just don’t like the new version. This means that it is one of the most stable operating systems apart from maybe Debian in my experience. 

# Solus 

Solus is a distro that I used to use. It is one of my favorites. It uses the eopkg package manager. It comes with it’s own desktop, called Budgie. It is  great for beginners, as it is very easy to install software using the software center. It is designed for desktops, offering no alternative for servers. It is great for people who need sommething simple. 

# Void

Void linux is a great alternative to something like arch. It is rolling release, while focusing on stability and speed. Like Gentoo, it does not use Systemd. It has the XBPS package manager, wich is fast and easy to use, It is also pretty easy to install, with a cli installer that is still very easy to use. 

# Slackware 

Slackware is old. Many veteran Linux users used it in the early 90’s. It treats Linux like a free clone of unix more than anything else. It is also, systemd free. It comes jam packad with packages so that you can get to work doing anything you need right away. It has a slow boot time, but surprisingly good system performance. The release cycle is very slow, however it is still supported and will continue to thrive for the foreseeable future.

# Conclusion

All of these are great Linux distros that all have their own niche. Whether its being old school, easy to use, or being super stable, they are all great at what they do. By being independent they can stay away from all the bad parts of Debian, RHEL, or Arch. They are all great and I would heavilly advise you to do some extra research if any of them catch your eye.
