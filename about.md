## Want To Make A Request? 

If you would like to request and article, or just realize that I have made a mistake, I would appreciate it if you would email me at the email hyperlinked below. 

## Critique Or Respond To A Blog

Sadly, Jeckyl does not allow you to write comments without the use of nonfree platforms. So, to protect your privacy and freedom, I have a Lemmy account where all my blogs get posted. There, you can comment and vote on my blogs.
